The `requirements.txt` file can be used to list out all project dependencies and their required versions. It should follow the following syntax

```
invoke==2.2.0
ruff==0.3.4
pyinstaller==6.5.0
```


#### Installing dependencies

```bash
(virtual-env) $ pip install -r ./path/to/requirements.txt
```
